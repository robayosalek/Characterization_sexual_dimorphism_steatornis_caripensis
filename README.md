Species with subtle and marked sexual dimorphism have been of great scientific interest, given the enthusiasm to understand the reasons of the physiological differences that are in the sexes of the same species. Those differences have been a puzzle even after Darwin's sexual selection hypothesis, which was gave by the lack of explanation using the natural selection's ideas. Therefore, being able to quantify these differences between males and females would make possible to understand better the ecological, behavioral, and mating differences associated with the sexes of the same species. In Steatornis caripensis a specie with slight sexual dimorphism, males are slightly larger and grayish than females, making it difficult to determine the sex of individuals in the field by means other than molecular sexing, which requires the use of invasive techniques. For this reason, I quantified biometric and reflectance measurements, to provide a detailed and precise characterization of sexual dimorphism in oilbirds that could be useful in the field identification of this unique specie.
